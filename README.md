## Step 1

- Fork this lab.
- Clone it into an appropriate folder.


## Step 2

- Navigate inside your cloned folder and create a new folder called `octocat`.
- Navigate inside the `octocat` folder and create a file called `tenticles.py`
- Open `tenticles.py` file in your text editor and write a comment of just the number 8. Save it.

## Step 3

- In your terminal, `add` your work. *
- `commit` your work.
- `push` your work.

* Remember to use `git status` to confirm that all of your work is being added and commited. If it's not, you may need to navigate outside of an interior folder or, when running the `git add` command, you may need torefrence the external folders with the `../`

## Step 4

- Navigate to your repo on Github to confirm that your work has been pushed.
- Create a `pull request` to submit your work.

## Hungry for More?

- Open up `tenticles.py` in your text editor and write a function that will print out the number of legs on an octocat.
- Save, add, commit, and push your work. Check Github to confirm that the updates are reflected in your code.
